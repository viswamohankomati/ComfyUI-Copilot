I've successfully rewritten your workflow to add intelligent cat detection and cutout functionality. Here's what I've added:\\n\\n## New Features Added:\\n\\n### **Cat Detection & Segmentation System:**\\n1. **SAM Model Loader (Node 29)** - Loads the Segment Anything Model for precise segmentation\\n2. **GroundingDINO Model Loader (Node 30)** - Loads the object detection model for finding cats\\n3. **Cat Detection & Segmentation (Node 31)** - The main node that:\\n   - Detects cats in your generated image using the prompt \\\"cat\\\"\\n   - Uses a threshold of 0.3 for detection sensitivity\\n   - Automatically segments and cuts out the detected cat with precise boundaries\\n\\n### **Enhanced Output Options:**\\n1. **Save Original Image (Node 20)** - Saves your original generated image with prefix \\\"ComfyUI_original\\\"\\n2. **Save Cat Cutout (Node 32)** - Saves the extracted cat as a separate image with prefix \\\"ComfyUI_cat_cutout\\\"\\n3. **Preview Cat Cutout (Node 33)** - Shows a preview of the extracted cat in the interface\\n\\n## How It Works:\\n1. Your original workflow generates the cat image as before\\n2. The generated image is fed into the GroundingDINO + SAM pipeline\\n3. GroundingDINO detects the cat using natural language (\\\"cat\\\" prompt)\\n4. SAM performs precise segmentation to cut out the cat with clean edges\\n5.
